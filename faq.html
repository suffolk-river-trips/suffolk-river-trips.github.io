            <h5>Are the boats open or covered?</h5>
          <p>
            All our boats are open so you get the best views of the birds, wildlife and scenery.
          </p>
          <h5>How many boats do you have and how many people can each boat take?</h5>
          <p>
          We have 3 boats, Tilly, Sea Tradar and Hagar.
          </p>
          <p>
          Tilly runs from Orford Quay, whilst Sea Tradar and Hagar run from Snape Maltings Quay.
          </p>
          <p>
          Tilly and Sea Tradar are licenced to take up to 12 passengers, Hagar is licenced to take up to 10 passengers.
          </p>
          <h5>When do you operate?</h5>
          <p>
          We run from Easter until the end of October. At Orford the trips times are the same each day but at Snape it depends on the tides, so please check the calendar for both dates and times.
          </p>
          <h5>How do I book and how far in advance?</h5>
          <p>
          You can book online via this website for both the Orford and Snape trips – for Snape you are directed to booking on the official Snape Maltings website www.snapemaltings.co.uk. We do also take bookings on the quay so you can just take a chance and turn up on the day if you prefer but we can get very busy at weekends and during holiday periods so advance booking a few days ahead is advisable if you want to guarantee a space. You can of course book earlier if you want.
          </p>
          <h5>Can I pay on card?</h5>
          <p>
            All advance online bookings can only be paid for by card. We can take card or cash payments on board if you choose to turn up on the day and purchase any spare tickets available.
          </p>
          <h5>Do I need to pay in advance?</h5>
          <p>
          Yes, if making an advance online booking. For any spare tickets purchased on the day  you will need to pay on board prior to the boats departure.
          </p>
          <h5>Where do the boats leave from?</h5>
          <p>
            Tilly departs from <a href="">Orford Town Quay (IP12 2NU)</a> and Sea Tradar and Hagar depart from Snape Quay at <a href="">Snape Maltings (IP17 1SP)</a>.
          </p>
          <h5>Do you provide life jackets for us to wear?</h5>
          <p>
          The MCA regulations state that we have to carry life jackets on board. Life jackets only have to be worn in an emergency.
          </p>
          <h5>Are there toilets on the boat?</h5>
          <p>
          No, sorry there are no toilets on board, there are however toilets in the car park behind the quay at Orford and toilets at Snape Maltings.
          </p>
          <h5>Is there a special rate for pensioners?</h5>
          <p>
          No - sorry the rate is the same as for adults.
          </p>
          <h5>My child is under 2 years of age – can they come on board for free?</h5>
          <p>
          No, all children under the age of 14 must purchase a children’s ticket. We are only licenced to take 10 or 12 passengers on each boat and under the Maritime and Coastguard Agency rules a child under 2 is counted as a person and thereby takes one of the licenced passenger spaces which must be paid for.
          </p>
          <h5>Do you go if it’s raining?</h5>
          <p>
            Yes - we go in all weathers if safe to do so. Very occasionally we do have to cancel if it's too windy. See <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.
          </p>
          <h5>Do I need to wear any special clothing?</h5>
          <p>
          No - but we advise sensible clothing to suit the weather (it’s always a bit cooler on the water!) Sensible footwear is also advised because if it’s raining it can sometimes be a bit slippery
          </p>
          <h5>Is there a car park?</h5>
          <p>
          Yes - there is a big “pay and display” car park in Orford, on the left handside as you drive down to Orford quay. At Snape Maltings there is ample free car parking.
          </p>
          <h5>How long are the boat trips?</h5>
          <p>
            The trip from Orford Quay lasts for about one hour and the trip from Snape Maltings is about 50 minutes.
          </p>
          <h5>What happens if the weather is bad, can I get a refund?</h5>
          <p>
          Suffolk River Trips boats often still run if the weather is rainy, cloudy or otherwise inclement. Occasionally, very high winds may call for a shorter journey or cancellation. If Suffolk River Trips have to cancel a trip completely you will be offered the choice to move your booking to another day or to receive a full refund if payment has already been made. If the boats are running a normal service despite the weather but you decide not to travel, then you will forfeit your ticket and not be entitled to a refund. See <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.
          </p>
          <h5>Can I take luggage/buggies on the boat?</h5>
          <p>
            The boats cannot accommodate bulky luggage. Items including, but not limited to pushchairs, buggies and luggage cannot be taken on the boats. Suffolk River Trips do not have a storage facility so any items left behind and unattended will be at the owner’s risk.
          </p>
          <h5>Can I bring a dog?</h5>
          <p>
          Yes, well-behaved dogs are always welcome – however, there may be other dogs aboard too so please do bear this in mind when deciding whether to bring your dog or not.
          </p>
          <h5>How much is a private charter?</h5>
          <p>
          There are a number of possibilities for a private charter from both Orford and Snape Maltings. If you would like to discuss particular requirements and costs for a private charter from either Orford or Snape Maltings then please do give us a call on 07793 307337 or email info@suffolkrivertrips.com
          </p>
          <h5>Can a wheelchair fit on board?</h5>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, due to the size of the boats and the limited floor area we are unable to accommodate wheelchairs. However, their occupants are more than welcome as long as they are able to board the boat albeit with assistance from their companions and /or the crew.
